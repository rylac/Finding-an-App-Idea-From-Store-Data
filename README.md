# Finding-an-App-Idea-From-Store-Data
based on 2018 Apple Store and Google Play app data.
In my first project, I will be trying to deduce which mobile apps are profitable based on App Store and Google Play Store data.
Using this information, I come up with an app idea of my own. edit: this was my first DS project. 
Might re-do this project at some point using np and pd to write more elegant code.
